# Wi-Fi Deauth Attack Tool

**Status:** Work in Progress ðŸš§

Welcome to the Wi-Fi Deauth Attack Tool project! This tool is designed for cybersecurity enthusiasts to learn about wireless network vulnerabilities by performing deauthentication attacks on Wi-Fi networks in a controlled environment. **Remember: This tool is for educational purposes only. Do not use it on networks you do not own or have permission to test.**

---

## Features

- **Deauthentication Attack:** Disconnect devices from a Wi-Fi network by sending deauth packets.
- **Interactive Menu:** Simple user interface to select targets and actions.
- **Network Scanner:** Identify nearby Wi-Fi networks and connected devices.
- **Logs:** Save attack details for later review.
- **Modular Design:** Clean and reusable code structure.

---

## Planned Features

- GUI support for easier usage.
- Multi-target attacks.
- Automatic return to managed mode after attacks.
- Advanced reporting (e.g., PDF export).
- Support for custom blacklists/whitelists.

## How to Use

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the tool:**
   ```bash
   sudo python3 main.py
   ```

3. **Follow the instructions:**
   - Enable monitor mode.
   - Scan for networks.
   - Select a target device and router.
   - Start the deauthentication attack.
